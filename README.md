# Camera Re-Identification

## Introduction 

Our goal is to develop a Person Re-Identification machine learning software capable of utilizing a bag of features to identify and recognize an individual which it has filmed before based on their unique physical traits. 

In order to develop this software, our team will build on existing OpenCV and Media Pipe open-source software libraries in order to build a superior product capable of one day seeing widespread adoption by institutions, governments, and private individuals.

Our software will be able to perform facial recognition as well as recognizing an individual based on height, arm, real-world and leg length as well as any other observable physical features that the camera network can gather data from. This is significant because our Person Re-Identification camera network will still be capable of recognizing an individual when the subjectâ€™s face is not oriented towards the camera.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Python

- **For Windows** : Go to the python [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page to download python. Remember to tick add to PATH in the installer. 

### 2. Clone Repository and Setup Environment

- Go to the directory where you wish to store
- Use ```git clone https://github.com/tanker43/Camera-ReIdentification.git``` to clone to that directory
- Create a python virtual environment with ```python -m venv venv```. (More information for python virtual enrionment can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))
- Install the necessary dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
